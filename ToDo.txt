Improve the sudoku creation. Maybe search for a good algorithm

search_closest_zero:
1 - don't search everything, keep a list of what has been completed
2 - keep list of tried cells per cycle to avoid looping

insert_number:
1 - skip completed numbers
     - Maybe send a list of 9 numbers that each represents how many of each number have been inserted, so if the second element equals 9, that means i already inserted all the twos (global list? parameters?)
